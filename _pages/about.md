*Namaste (নমস্কার) 🙏*, I am **Sohom Ghosh**. I like developing innovative solutions for solving real life challenges. For nearly a decade, I've had the privilege of **revolutionizing digital experiences** and **enhancing financial well-being** for millions of users. From innovative internet startups to established financial institution, I've consistently delivered solutions that bridge the gap between complex technology and real human needs. Presently, I am working as a **Machine Learning Engineer** at [Apple Inc](https://www.apple.com/){:target="_blank"}. Before this, I worked as a **Senior Data Scientist** for the **Artificial Intelligence, Centre of Excellence of** [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/){:target="_blank"}, and  for [Times Internet](https://timesinternet.in){:target="_blank"} (digital wing of The Times Group). My research interests include **Industrial Applications of Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and GenAI**. Here is my [CV](../assets/pdf/Sohom_Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}. <br> 

In addition to being a US patent holder, co-author of the books [Natural Language Processing Fundamentals](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=i8-PDwAAQBAJ&newbks=0){:target="_blank"} and [The Natural Language Processing Workshop](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/The_Natural_Language_Processing_Workshop/Gif4DwAAQBAJ){:target="_blank"}, I have several [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7Jm4_McAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} in international venues of repute, such as **ACM TheWebConf (WWW), ACM CIKM, COLING, LREC, IEEE BigData**, and so on. I earned a **PhD Degree** in **Engineering (Computer Science)** from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. I also hold a **Master's Degree** in **Software Systems (with specialization in Data Analytics)** from [BITS Pilani, India](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}.

<summary> Beyond Work 🧗 𝄞 📏 ♫ 🥋 <i>(click here to expand)</i> </summary>
Outside work, I like <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWVXvBh2xmj8BHN7jBCsaKpd5JP4xOT7T" target="_blank">travelling</a>, and playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWVXvBh2xmj_yWcdldvo6w1LD1C-d4xSw" target="_blank">harmonica</a>. As an avid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWVXvBh2xmj-XlHYzumNLZazfpmim4klq" target="_blank">adventure sports enthusiast</a>, I have experienced the thrill of diverse activities across spectacular destinations. From the adrenaline rush of <strong>river rafting and bungee jumping</strong> in Rishikesh to the underwater wonders discovered while <strong>scuba diving</strong> in the Andaman Islands, and from soaring through the skies while <strong>paragliding</strong> in Kalimpong to the exhilarating experience of <strong>flyboarding</strong> in Goa - each adventure has fueled my passion for pushing boundaries, self-discovery, and exploring new horizons. I have earned a <strong>yellow belt in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)</strong>, and have successfully completed some of the <strong>world's most thrilling treks</strong>, from <a href="https://youtu.be/w82B-c4-mzk?si=Jr3t_xnrVpYtbNHB" target="_blank">Everest Base Camp with Gokyo</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/EpNa9uxCqFA?si=q_DoYzY8dwUK1nDl" target="_blank">Goechala</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/d3BLY5b4-P8?si=hhdI33vLNKE3C2gU" target="_blank">Bali Pass</a>, just to name a few. I received the <strong>Green Getter</strong>, and <strong>Trekker for Life</strong> awards from Indiahikes in recognition of my contributions to Green Trails - an Indiahikes initiative dedicated to leaving the mountains better than we find them. I captivated audiences & judges with my <a href="https://youtu.be/FBsPGEmfPSw?si=Og3278Ffmfy6V9FE" target="_blank">harmonica performance</a>, securing the <strong>runner-up</strong> position at EGL Got Talent (Energize-2024). I have visited 22 of India’s 27 states and 3 of its 7 union territories.
