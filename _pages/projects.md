# Selected Projects

## Fidelity Assistant
Experimenting with various content based filtering, collaborative filtering, pattern mining algorithms, network graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs) based approaches to predict the next interaction (questions, quicklinks) of a customer during a chat session. Using LLMs to evaluate effectiveness of FA sessions. 

#### Relevant Publications: 
- "Dichotomic Pattern Mining Integrated With Constraint Reasoning for Digital Behavior Analysis" in Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence (Journal) <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2022.868085/full" target="_blank">(link)</a>

## Voice of Customers
Experimented with Large Language Models (T5, Falcon, MPT, Open‑Laama). Created Bi‑LSTM, T5, LED & BART based models for summarizing &
extracting multiple themes from call transcripts. Used Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering recursively to group similar themes. Designed
the annotation job using Appen and administered a team of 98 annotators. <br>
Applications: <br>
i) Automated short note generation for calls, <br>
ii) Comprehending reasons behind high call volumes, <br>
iii) Featurization of textual interaction data. <br>
Impact: <br>
i) Issues related to login were identified & resolved leading to 10% increase in customer satisfaction score <br>
ii) Workflow for different processes were updated leading to increase in Net Promoter Score and Customer Ease Score by 18 points & 27% respectively <br>
iii) Competent solution to address the student debt crisis was created which lead to 60% increase in enrollment, 59K yearly payments & $200M+ being paid to the participants.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on Call Transcripts
Experimented with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer business queries from call transcripts. Worked on various chunking and denoising strategies. Explored several frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, FAISS, Chroma DB, etc.
