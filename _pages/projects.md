## Voice of Customers
Experimented with Large Language Models (T5, Falcon, MPT, Open‑Laama). Created Bi‑LSTM, T5, LED & BART based models for summarizing &
extracting multiple themes from call transcripts. Used Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering recursively to group similar themes. Designed
the annotation job using Appen and administered a team of 98 annotators. <br>
Applications: <br>
i) Automated short note generation for calls, <br>
ii) Comprehending reasons behind high call volumes, <br>
iii) Featurization of textual interaction data. <br>
Impact: <br>
i) Issues related to login were identified & resolved leading to 10% increase in customer satisfaction score <br>
ii) Workflow for different processes were updated leading to increase in Net Promoter Score and Customer Ease Score by 18 points & 27% respectively <br>
iii) Competent solution to address the student debt crisis was created which lead to 60% increase in enrollment, 59K yearly payments & $200M+ being paid to the participants.
